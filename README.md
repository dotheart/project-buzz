# project-buzz
 Plot twist: we're already drunk.

## How to setup
1. Install **Github Desktop** from https://desktop.github.com/ and log in
2. In Github Desktop, go **File > Clone Repository...** 
3. From the Github.com list, select **team-ubee/project-buzz**
4. Select a nice destination path somewhere on your PC
5. Click the blue **CLONE** button!

## How to use with Unity
1. Download and install **Unity Hub** from https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
2. From within Unity Hub, in the **Install** menu, select to install **Unity 2020.3.17f1**
3. Once installed, from Unity Hub, select to **Open Project**. 
4. Navigate to the nice destination path previously used, and then enter the **buzz** folder within!
5. The project will now take a decade to open!

## How to sync files from others
1. If you want to check for new stuff from collaborators, press the big **Fetch origin** in the top bar.
2. What just happened?! You got all the file changes from all collaborators.
3. Hope that we haven't fucked everything up, and if we have...
4. That's why we have the üêù-prog-hive!

## How to get your files to everyone else
1. Once you're done with everything in PS/Unity/Blender/etc., open **Github Desktop** again if it's not already open
2. Check that all the files you need are in the **Changes** menu to the left (there might be **more files**, as Unity has some extras)
3. Write a short **summary** and **description** down below
4. Press the **Commit to main**
5. Press the huge **Push to origin** (or something like that) blue button (sometimes this might say **Pull from Origin** first, just trust it!).
6. You are good! Everyone else... see you in the üêù-prog-hive.
